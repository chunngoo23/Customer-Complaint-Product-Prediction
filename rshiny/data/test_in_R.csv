"a lthough i am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of reporting compliances and not contesting any debt of compliant nature i should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards it is to be announced yet again that legally i have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each might it be known especially shall i elect to take this matter up to a civil court any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued particularly for collection in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim s to include but not limited to the fcba fcra hipaa privacy rule facta fdcpa and tcpa etc additionally if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards to date the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair accurate complete and compliant reporting of the claims particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro compliance as such given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories i am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate i deny nothing yet i reserve the right to question any unproven claim i do not accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and i call for the court to reject their claim as untrue unverified incomplete not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full i demand said court resolution today even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes mentioned by me or not to date i have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to be plaintiff s should i forward into a civil complaint or with the entity ies that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit s or accusations similar this despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me i have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned in any form i have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging or even unknowingly doing so that i owe any proven and compliantly reported debt much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration checking for not only validity of claims but also document proof in certifiable testimony as to the factual and complete compliance to all standards and laws even the mandatory metro format compliance its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers or to be plaintiff are in clear subterfuge of act be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations collection efforts and credit reporting of claims the vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt i again call for a dismissal of to be plaintiffs statement of claim s and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me i have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions again i reiterate i have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true correct complete and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims rights to collect alleged claims and rights to report alleged claims let it be true that compliance of regulatory requisites is mandatory not optional plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed i have no knowledge of ever entering into a open account with to be plaintiff s or with the entity ies that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit s or derogatory claims of credit fact is no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer creditor relationship and their inability to prove application permissible purpose for said alleged application consumer creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt s and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim s inherently makes invalid the to be plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint i request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required

"i have only months to go until my mortgages maturity date with wells fargo bank which at a month should only be in payments but in unexplained charges were incorporated into my principal balance for assessment fees which will cause me to unjustly go into foreclosure with just months away after noticing how high my principal was about years ago i called and visited the bank to ask why and for almost two years i was assured that the principal balance included the advanced payments made by the bank for taxes and insurance that an agreement was made to pay back by the maturity date of my loan but starting last year the bank executives changed the story and said that the owed for taxes insurance was itemized in its own column on the statement and after all were not a part of the principal balance but instead included other unnamed charges these unexplained charges are listed only throughout the summary sheets as assessment fees but totaled up and hidden in the principal balance rather than in a column to easily distinguish the charges such as was done for taxes ins and late fees this causes a false default of my contract because based on the maturity date no new loans or modifications all legal contracts are designed to pay off on schedule as mine should by all verifiable accounts however while making monthly payments their newest abrupt assessment of charges gave me only two years to come up with the unexplained added in my pb in addition to the undisputed owed for taxes ins totaling rather than the true amount of near my account was assigned to one executive after another for the past year or so who all requested days for review and they all ended up sending out the very same package of summaries with years of normal transactions a copy of my deeds and explanations about how i did in fact owe for taxes and insurance for which i stated over and over even in an email i did not dispute as early as yesterday    after another month investigation a wells fargo executive called to give her conclusive findings and it was the same as all the rest she stated i do in fact owe for taxes and insurance to be paid by the maturity date i said to her i made it very clear that those charges are not in dispute you said you would investigate the fees charges incorporated into my pricipal balance and she said we have no record of you actually requesting that specific investigation as if no record for such request would be used for any potential legal claim i then advised her that the request for my only concern was also put in the email to the board of communications on    and from that email my account was assigned to you and therefore you did know which charges were in dispute and to be investigated not once did any of them mention assessment fees in their letters or verbal responses they disregarded the term altogether as they kept committing to days or more of fake investigations that is quickly leading me to run out of time for coming up with the money for paying the bogus fees one executive told me that those fees can only come from foreclosures reappraisals or modification loans none of which i have had and that is likely why the bankers disregard explaining the fees altogether i also googled assessement fees and it states that those are fees that the bank owe but charge to the customer i have two other complaints that i wont go as far into details for now to add insult to injury wf recently raised my monthly note by almost by starting an untimely estrow by adding the latest ins premium into it which breaks the two decade agreement to pay back all ins premiums by the maturity date it all seems to be designed to force me into foreclosure after paying for my home complaint in the past few years wf switched my loan from a hone equity loan to a mortage loan likely depriving me of easier equity benefits for emergencies such as these also my maturity date was moved from    to    without my signature knowledge or permission by the previous loan holder before and wf tookover but wf states that because i had two extensions each for two payments of my principal was made higher but i was told that the two extensions would simply put those payments at the end of the loan but i found out recently that it was instead handled like a refinancing causing my maturity date to unknowingly change with an agent at   the former account holder forging my signature which i saw for the first time in my copy of deeds that wf sent to me although the unauthorized changing of the maturity date was designed to accommodate the notes being put on the end of the loan for a total of wf executives still claimed that those notes affected the balance and caused the in overcharges rather than it being the assessment fees which based on the high amount and the new maturity date can not possibly be accurate the new ceo of wells fargo assured its customers that we would no longer be victims of the banks bogus fees and scams but it has clearly not stopped thank you for your attention in this matter","Mortgage"

"the entire balance of my target credit card was used fraudulently and after three months i had to call in for two months straight and keep re explaining the situation before the investigation began all the while they continued to charge payments and fees and report negatively to the bureaus after two months i finally reach an investigator who flat out denies the entire claim with no reason at all and tells me i should request a different investigator because he did not want to deal with it so i did and sent even more supporting documentation in this no totaling police reports ftc report statement of what occurred and more supporting documentation than i am sure most do i also explained how the claim was not being taken seriously and how i have received zero communication etc finally after another month of calling i get put through to the new investigators voicemail where i asked her to please seriously address our concerns and let me know what i needed to provide her to prove our claim a week later she leaves me a voicemail at  on a weeknight stating that although they understand the claims are fraudulent they are standing by the denial and i am responsible for all fees incurred and the fraudulent charges that was over a week ago now she also provided a phony return phone number on her voicemail however i was able to get her real one and have left her voicemails since with no response no letter no nothing i believe my complaint is best summed up in the last letter i sent to target twice that they continue to ignore urgent to whom it may concern target fraud dept ok guys we have a huge problem here let me start by saying i know my rights and how you guys have gone about handling my fraud case from day one has been completely illegal under the fair credit and the consumer financial protection bureaus policies from sending me to collections after i submitted a fraud claim in writing by certified mail to taking well over two billing cycles to even address the matter continuing to report negatively to the bureaus and charge me fees and try to force me to make payments to me receiving zero documentation as to the outcome or status of my claim the way your fraud department speaks to victims i could go on but i am sure you are well aware it is all completely illegal and i will not allow you to continue to destroy my credit and my financial well being i am a well documented victim of identity theft theft and fraud and have supplied all of the necessary paperwork over five times including two police reports a federal trade commission report a clear and concise explanation of what and how it happened and complied with the excessive amount of personal information requested even though you guys allowed all of your customers information to get stolen before of which i was also a victim of after three months of attempting i finally get through to an investigator who flat out states that he understands that these charges were to theft but that he was denying my claim due to lack of evidence i provided more evidence than i am sure most do in fraud claims furthermore not only was my target credit stolen but my      etc and all those claims were investigated and found to be valid i asked the investigator what i needed to provide him with to ensure he had the satisfactory amount of evidence he desired and he refused to tell me and said nothing i could provide him would change the decision again completely illegal i even asked that he pull the store footage as a means of definitively proving the charges were fraudulent to which he laughed and stated we dont do that the investigator went on in a tone that clearly indicated he was enjoying the cruelty of what he was doing and plain up stated that he didnt want to deal with it anymore and recommended i request a different investigator which is exactly what i did again through certified letter as well as snail mail fax and phone calls i supplied the original documents affidavit and new documentation including new police report solely for the stolen target card after two weeks of being promised someone would get in contact an investigator leaves me a voicemail in the evening stating she too is denying the claim and that they wont be providing me with a reason as they do not have to also completely illegal and then provides a phony return phone number i have recorded every single phone call and have a portfolio of evidence as to the complete negligence of your fraud team to properly and as protected under law investigate this fraud claim the recordings and documentation overwhelming support and verify everything im saying i was hit with fraud and theft on a massive family crippling scale including     federal etc and you are the only organization refusing to properly investigate this and attempting to deny my claim i have not received a single shred of paperwork nor have i been properly notified of the denial or that the appeal was taking place you also did not update the bureaus as to the investigation or the appeal which is again completely illegal per the law you need to remove the derogatory remarks from my credit reports and acknowledge that the time has passed for this investigation and restore my credit i need to either hear from someone or see this has all be done by   tomorrow friday or i will be filing complaints

"we are repeat customers after having a reasonably good experience with a refinance in  with    at paramount equity mortgage this time however the lack of communication broken promises incorrect information interest rate errors and fluctuations promise of cash out availability through our escrow refund payment relief months loan timing loan fees manipulation of our appraisal amount and failure to inform us of changes that paramount insisted that the appraiser make to reduce our homes value failure to honor our request to cancel provide cancellation paperwork etc have been fabricated at best fraudulent at worst we were clear in explaining to   that we wanted to refinance our new home to get out of the year arm we were in at interest rate and use cash available to help our daughter pay off student loans this was all about getting into an improved fixed interest rate and helping our daughter we did not have to refinance right now we just bought our newly built home in    our appraisal came in lower than expected at but  assured us that we would have our escrow account refund of approximately and months of payment relief another to use for our daughter instead of equity when the first closing statement was generated we were astonished to see that we were still in an arm and the documents reflected our former address we identified the errors and asked him again to get us into a lower fixed rate and lock it in we started providing the requested documentation in  at the end of  we still had no new loan in place and another mortgage payment due we did not know what the hold up was so we paid the  payment  later informed us that our cash would be less since our only payment relief would be in the month of  they were pushing to close the loan by the  of  with our first payment due on the new loan in    again this was not something we requested or needed it was another assumption or rather necessity on the part of the lender to close our loan by a certain time  also led us to believe all during the process that we would have no out of pocket expenses but at signing on    the closing statement included  in fees that we were to wire transfer points on the loan were all over the board in the various closing statements presented to us in the process  continued even on this date to lead my husband to believe that we were going to receive our escrow account refund from     even though there was a document showing that our escrow account was being used to pay down our principal at loan payoff to   and that he was working to reduce eliminate the  we were being asked to pay in closing costs when i pointed the escrow concern out to my husband at signing he assured me again that  said it was coming to us we are not experts at reading these documents and trusted that  was giving us truthful and accurate information on the third day following our doc signing     emailed us with a reduced closing fee of that we were still expected to pay by wire transfer in response on    my husband emailed him and stated that we wanted to cancel the loan and would not pay the fee during doc signing when i reviewed the closing statement for the new escrow account set up i was also concerned that the new payment was set up incorrectly and would generate a shortfall after the taxes are paid again in  resulting in a big increase to next year s payments i placed a call to our lender at that time     and learned that indeed the taxes planned for payment in  were underestimated and the request for a payoff from paramount did indeed instruct them to reduce the principal balance by the amount of our escrow account meaning we would never receive the escrow refund promised by  the out of pocket expense lost escrow refund excessive loan fees additional on the interest rate and mistakes in the new escrow set up were all reasons why we informed  on    that we were canceling the loan we were at work on    when all of this was identified so my husband emailed  to cancel the loan and requested any required documentation for the cancellation to be provided they talked later on    and my husband explained everything verbally as well this date was critical in the cancellation process as it was day three following our doc signing  seemed surprised by the escrow refund issue and wanted to see if there was anything else he could do about the out of pocket expenses so he said he would get back to us since this was the third day a call back that night was expected we didn t hear from him again for more business days however the loan didn t get canceled and much to our frustration and disappointment it actually funded on    without our knowledge this seems like a delay tactic that ensured that we could not cancel since time ran out and the loan did end up being funded on the following monday the strange thing is that  called my husband back on    to convince us to go forward with the loan because they were able to entirely remove the fees we were supposed to wire my husband said no the escrow refund and new escrow set up are even bigger issues now and not what we agreed to all during the day on    we had no idea that the loan had actually already funded however i checked our bank app on the evening of    after we found a  package under our mat containing a small refund check from the title company sure enough the refi was funded on    even though   clearly knew we wanted to cancel on friday    this is not the deal we were sold escrow refund promised used in payoff without our knowledge approval months of payment relief promised is now only due to lack of communication from  our new lower monthly mortgage payment was used as an appealing sales tactic however the new escrow account will produce a shortfall after the  tax payment is made resulting in a higher payment in  interest rate not as low as originally quoted initially quoted ended up at exorbitant loan costs buried in closing statement points then drastically reduced in order to push our loan through after we requested cancellation requested cancellation by email and phone along with the refusal to accept pay the borrower closing fees shown in the closing statement not honored instead paramount eliminated our out of pocket fees entirely and without notifying us so that they could push the loan through we did not get a revised closing statement until the loan was funded which was delivered on    on the morning of    my husband forwarded the above complaint statements to   by email to let him know that if we didnt receive our full escrow account refund as he promised we would file a  complaint and post this information on  as well we did not hear from  again until later in the week when he sent us a defensive apology stating that he had waived his entire commission to make the deal work for us however a district sales manager   reached out to us on    and we had a conference call that evening it included my husband  and me  offered us loan reversal however before agreeing to reversal we discussed the appraised value and why they took our escrow funds in the loan he stated that we only appraised at however we paid for our home in  of  and our copy of our appraisal in this process shows a value of was less than expected however as new homes are selling above for our model in our neighborhood in addition we discussed that if our loan to value was seeming to indicate a need for pmi that was never offered as an option by  and would have indicated to us that there was a discrepancy in our appraisal on their end in any event we all agreed that loan reversal was the answer i was able to locate our copy of the appraisal and provided it to  by email on    and he sent his copy to us they do bear a difference i found the discrepancy in the value of the solar panels which we financed with our mortgage loan when purchasing our new home  also provided the name and contact information for the appraiser so i reached out to him he explained that his first appraisal that we were copied on was in the amount of however paramount contacted him and insisted that he reduce his value by the amount of the solar or due to our solar being leased this is incorrect he said it is usually included but he had to comply with their request as they are the customer this all happened in the background and we were not notified that loan calculations were being made based on a lower appraised value than we had received in writing our first documents generated and sent to us for electronic signatures reflect an appraised value of internally they changed this figure and slipped it by us with no notification we find it confusing and unacceptable that they would insist on a lower valuation than what was provided by their professional appraiser on    i received a voicemail at work from   a vice president with paramount i provided his name and number to my husband for the return call  explained that he has only walked one loan back through a reversal in the last years and its a difficult process which can take up to three weeks so he wanted to negotiate a way to avoid loan reversal the next day     offered us in addition to the refund of already provided at closing for the loss of our escrow refund my husband said that we also wanted a lower interest rate and everything in writing before we agreed to forgo loan reversal  said he would call back and we have not heard from him since    my husband has called him no less than times during the week of       leaving voicemail messages but to no avail we also never heard again from   we seem to have come to an impasse and again a delay tactic is at work to make the reversal all but impossible","Mortgage"

that i had indeed filed that specific cfpb complaint in neither his telephone message nor his email however did mr  specify as to which of the numerous cfpb complaint s that i have filed about bank of america that he was referring to even assuming that it was one of the most recent complaints mr  did not specify as to whether his outreach was in reference to cfpb complaint  in which i was similarly directed by bank of america regulatory complaints representative    to call her by   to confirm that i had indeed filed that specific cfpb complaint or subsequent complaint  shown below which was specifically in reference to bank of america attempts to place the duty to respond on the consumer and insisting on a non documentation method of communication giving bank of america the opportunity to claim that they responded but the consumer did not and giving bank of america the opportunity to attempt to coerce the consumer into dropping their complaint in other words for doing the exact same thing all over again to avoid documentation of wrongdoing regardless the body context of the emails of mr  and ms  was identical in wording indicating that they are generic it is noted that the response from ms  was emailed to me on   days after i filed complaint  and gave me days to respond it was preceded by a telephone message that was almost totally unintelligible this call from mr  came on   days after i filed complaint  and gave me days to respond and was followed by the email of   shown below in addition a second unintelligible telephone message presumably from the same person who left the first unintelligible telephone message was left subsequent to the telephone message of mr  this similarity in time frames days after being notified of the complaint by cfpb and directing me to respond verbally within days indicate that the call from mr  is in response to complaint  based on that assumption it appears that not only is bank of america doing the exact same thing all over again to continue to avoid documentation of wrongdoing but under the circumstances has not even bothered to read the complaint in the first place bank of america insists upon written documents in customer transactions there is no valid reason for its refusal to do likewise in disputes from enterprise resolution  date thu   at   subject acknowledgement of inquiry to   mr  our regulatory

to trivialize against bank of america    and  at no time previous did bank of america respond by directing not suggesting me to call them to confirm that i made a complaint before they would complete a review of my concerns placing the duty to respond on the consumer and insisting on a non documentation method of communication gives bank of america the opportunity to claim that they responded but the consumer did not it also gives bank of america the opportunity to attempt to coerce the consumer into dropping their complaint bank of america has received more than adequate information to confirm that i am in fact the person who has filed the complaint not as bank of america attempts to trivialize a concern including but not limited to the fact that i am personally known by the two bank of america officials the branch manager and branch operations manager that are the primary subjects of the subject complaint this is another duplicitous and reprehensible tactic by the bank of america designed to prevent documentation of willful negligence and to trivialize blatant discrepancies it appears that that the company calling me is a bank of america sub contractor or company that tries to mediate disputes and that bank of america is attempting to circumvent the cfpb","Checking or savings account"

"i had sufficient funds on my cash app account more than and because of an urgent situation i needed to withdraw cash from this account at an atm in the amount of on thursday    so off the atm i go upon arriving at the drive up atm around   cst on the    located at my personal and local   branch i went through the normal process as one does initiate and execute a cash withdrawal from an atm using my cash app visa card during this transaction i had subsequently requested a receipt to be printed for my record keeping upon successful completion of this transaction and anticipated dispersement of those funds all as fine and normal as it usually goes for this sort of transaction and there was no activity to have occurred to indicate a problem error or issue with my transaction and ability to have it processed by this particular machine so after submitting the request for cash in the amount of agreeing to accept the additional fee of for using a non bank atm for this service then waiting for the money to dispense from the little doors while listening the machine as it processed this transaction the atm screen suddenly the cut to black then restarted to the standard welcome message it greets one with when before they enter their card to initiate a transaction no receipt popped out nothing right before this occurred i was directed however to remove my card from the machine before it released the money which i complied with anyway this happens and i m expecting the doors to open regardless because my money should be ready and available now that the transaction successfully processed but the doors that dispense the money didn t open nor did a receipt pop out however i immediately received both a text message and email confirmation time stamped at   cst from cash app confirming that this transaction had indeed been successfully processed in addition to the atm fee but that s the problem i wasn t dispensed that cash the transaction went through successfully but that atm never rebased the physical cash to me frantic i parked my car and ran into the bank lobby as the atm was a drive thru version to hunt down a staff member to help me figure out what went wrong and thereby fix the issue so i could get my cash that failed to appear so i found an employee who after explaining what had happened at the atm outside went out to look at the machine and investigate several minutes later he returned only to report back to me that from what he was able to conclude this error was not a result of a malfunction or error with the atm itelsef but instead a processing error that transpired during the transaction and because of that and since the funds were not  funds using a  debit card to withdraw my only course of action to recoup this money was to contact the issuer of the card and source of those funds cash app i couldn t believe my ears first that this wasn t an atm malfunction it was not but more so that  literally could not and would not do anything more to assist because it literally had nothing to do with them or their services which i understand completely but how does this happen and why and why now so as he recommended while still in the bank lobby i get my phone open the app and proceed to locate cash app s contact information to immediately call so that action could proceed immediately to resolve and rectify this situation as a result there was nothing the bank could do and i was directed to contact cash app immediately about the whereabouts of this money frantic i went to find the contact information for this company and to my horror there isn t really any aside from the option to either text or email their support team i was absolutely stupefied to learn of this because how would one get any action taken on situations like the current one i m in without talking to a live person so with no other choice but those two options i sent the cash app a message via text and email to their support detailing the incident outlined above what i received only added to my level of horror and incredulousness a canned response to both messages that they would look into it and i would hear back in about ten business days or so no ticket number no request for additional information nothing so here i am eight business days later    still without that in cash i expected to received plus the additional atm fee so that i could tend to the urgent situation that had arisen that day thereby requiring my need of those funds immediately in order to resolve so i m not just still out of that but my situation went from urgent to emergency and i m in a very bad very very bad financial predicament as a result because the only funds available to me failed to materialize for reasons i don t understand or know and in these past eight days i have not received one email one text message one phone call or one attempt by cash app support to provide me with details about what happened why and the actions they would be taking immediately in order to rectify i have received no follow up and i have since reached out several times since the    with inquiries about this problem only to be further stonewalled and ignored aside from their canned boilerplate and obviously vaguely worded emails that were received immediately after submitting a request for support on the    by cash app i have not heard or been provided with any form of communication to indicate there is action on their end being taken in this matter i have no ticket or incidence number from my o initial support request made via text and email on the    and i do not receive any type of acknowledgment to my subsequent inquiries made between then and today    i have also not been contacted or asked by cash app to provide additional details of the incident that can prove useful or helpful in their investigation of events here literally nothing not one word nothing this can not possibly be legal right unfortunately i suppose it is now it has been over six business days and despite multiple attempts via email  to their   handle and text to get an update and despite contacting    as they are part of the cash app credit card puzzle and who filed a ticket requesting to follow up with an update to me with cash app support which was the only action they could take in their position and role as business partners with cash app and despite returning to my  bank and the scene of the incident a week later    to appeal to the branch manager   if there could be anything done on their end who then himself attempted to find ways to get resolution for this and timely resolution at that there has been no update no refund of funds no credit of funds no communication nothing absolutely nothing this is not cash app s normal complaint of basic human stupidity for getting scammed for goods and services then realizing you got screwed this was the processing and transaction of several hundred dollars that failed to dispense as they should have this was not do to insufficient funds atm malfunction or anything else it happened because of something glitching on square cash app s end and to put it lightly i have little faith any action has been taken at all on their end to look into and resolve this because it s not that uncommon of an incident to occur but it shouldn t take longer than a week to resolve between parties and at the very least provide an update response nothing how is that not theft and fraud worse yet when reading through all their disclosures to try to figure out who else to contact to get involved with resolving this expeditiously every phone number listed in their legal and financial disclosures with exception for the phone number for   were dead numbers square s number dead cash app s number it tells you to go submit a support request online of via the app the number listed on my bank statement for the transactions to transfer money into my account a few days before this incident dead how this company was given the legal go ahead is beyond me and then i learn they re not fdic insured great meanwhile i m literally  up the creek cashless in an even worse financial position because of this and who knows when they ll get around to resolving this or at what rate and where the  is my unbelievable i ll be filing complaints with every agency both state and federal detailing this

"back in  of  i discovered that my perfect credit had been ruined because there were accounts on my report that were charged off or in collections there was three specifically the   company pentagon federal credit union     i found out because i was attempting to purchase a home and the mortgage lender informed me this was preventing me from being able to qualify i ve had a score for as long as i can remember i have never once paid a bill late or have been in collections furthermore none of the three companies that were reporting on my credit report are mine nor have i ever associated with any of them because of this i began an investigation and took steps to begin having these accounts removed from my credit report i did so by calling all the companies listed on the report which were erroneous as well as filing a police report i did so back in  of  at first they kept telling me they were going to take care of it but that never seemed to happen i would call all three of the creditors over the months and i kept getting the same response after nearly a year of no results i finally decided to hire a professional to assist me i contacted a local company who has been helping consumers for many years in  when i contacted this consumer advocacy company they informed me that i should supplement the police report with a notarized id theft affidavit i went ahead and did so in  of  they assisted me in filling it out and submitting it to all three major credit bureaus as well as every creditor and collector listed on the report at first i would receive what i call bogus noticed from the credit bureaus asking me for more identification so i went ahead and provided them with whatever they were asking for after several months i finally began making some sort of headway on my credit   deleted all the fraudulent accounts on my credit report once   deleted the accounts from my report i believed things would go well from that point on unfortunately they didn t  did delete of the three fraudulent accounts from my credit report but  didn t remove a single one it frustrated me even more because one of the collectors the    actually sent me a letter stating they would be deleting themselves off my report how can the actual collector who sent me a notice in writing saying they are being deleted from my credit report still be verified by  that is impossible unless  is not doing their job also if  and   both deleted the wheel parts account because it was invalid and fraud how can  claim it was legitimate they can t unless they are not doing a real investigation this is not the end of it either over the last week i have been receiving calls from a collector asking me for my social security number and refusing to speak with me unless i provided them with my full number i went back to the consumer advocates who were helping me and they got a hold of this company as well  was their name without going into too much detail to save us all time it will suffice to say that the manager  informed us he just received the account for collections from pentagon federal credit union month ago because my notarized affidavit as well as police report was provided to all creditors collectors and credit bureaus since  why would the creditor send me to collections without responding to my fraud claim first i am now really upset because i feel like i am being discriminated against the collection agency was notified i have filled out a notarized id theft affidavit as well as police report and submitted it to pentagon credit union months ago i demanded they cease collections and cancel the account back to their client or they would be included in this complaint as well please help me in stopping  as well as pentagon federal credit union in stopping from reporting these fraudulent accounts on my credit report if this doesn t work my only other option is a lawsuit as i have exhausted all other means of getting these companies to correct their records","Debt collection"

"i had originally filed a complaint about td bank with the cfpb on    that complaint id number is  to summarize i included an additional principal payment with my normal mortgage payment and it was mishandled the entire payment was put into unapplied funds instead of being applied properly td bank fixed the payment after the complaint was filed td bank has performed the same actions every month since then with my extra payment every month i put in an extra principal amount i fill out their payment coupon properly clearly stating in the line marked extra principal the extra amount every month the payment is put into unapplied funds until i call or possibly a week later during these times my online account has always stated i owe on the first of the month i wrote a follow up to my original complaint but it was unanswered this last month  i made yet another mortgage payment with an additional principal the payment was made on    as normal the payment showed up as unapplied funds i waited a few days and this time the payment was changed improperly online it showed my unapplied funds going totally to my extra principal instead of a normal mortgage payment with additional principal my online account also was updated since the first of the month stating that i owe my normal mortgage amount due this past    i called td bank on    concerning this i was told my issue had been forwarded to a higher department to fix as of today    the funds have still not been applied properly my mortgage was due on    since these funds were not properly serviced by td bank i am now late with my mortgage payment it is quite obvious td bank is in direct violation of the udaap unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices td bank repeatedly mishandles my mortgage payments a quick view of my payment history shows how every month i have dealt with the same issue having my online mortgage statement say i owe  is deceptive adding this extra burden for me to repeatedly and constantly follow up every mortgage payment with phone calls and non stop monitoring is unfair td banks response to my previous complaint included a phone number for me to call if issues re appeared that phone number is incorrect again more blatant abuse from td bank there is no way i can avoid these abusive acts by td bank please review my previous complaint unanswered follow up to that complaint attached below i believe any hint of a late payment should be expunged from all records credit reports or other history and td bank should be heavily fined for these continued unfair practices original complaint on    i attempted to pay my mortgage at a td bank branch the mortgage payment coupon slip clearly states mortgage payment it also has a part for you to add additional principle or additional escrow and to total i added an additional  towards my principle the transaction took quite a while and included  members of the staff including the manager i heard them clearly state to put the amount of  in the extra principle field i received a simple receipt stating i made a loan pymt in the total of my normal payment plus the  extra principle on    my account had not been properly credited the online account showed there was a misc receipt made on    and the outstanding balance of my mortgage had not reflected any payment since the prior month i went back to the branch that day and spoke with the manager   she was one of the employees present when i attempted my payment while with her she contacted her account support by phone they said my payment was used as a pre payment for future mortgage payments not as a normal mortgage payment with an extra principle deposit ms  explained how the local branch put applied the payment accordingly and was told something went wrong she was reassured the issue would be corrected that evening and the change would show the next day this change would also reflect the payment was made on the   ms  suggested in the future i write two checks and make separate payments to my mortgage if i want to pre pay my principle this is a bit odd as the mortgage coupon slip and the banks system has a spot for me to make an extra principle deposit i was also told by ms  that she would follow up with my payment and contact me the next day to ensure it was done properly i have not received any contact from td bank as of yet as of today    my account has not been updated this costs me the daily interest accruing on the mortgage it is very wrong for a bank to treat its customers this way i do not blame the branch employees as they did what they could have to make the proper payment requiring me to write separate checks to make extra principle payments should not happen original follow up prior to receiving td banks response to my compliant i received a phone call from   on this issue my account was properly adjusted as stated i was told if i have any other questions to contact her directly via the number on the reply i would and did  receive i believed everything would be fine and this complaint could be put to rest in  i made a payment to my loan for the normal amount plus  extra principle the check cleared my bank on    my online account once again had the payment entered as a misc receipt i tried to contact   via the number given to me on td banks reply to this complaint  that number does not reach  but a voicemail for   i left messages with no reply there was no indication   has any affiliation with td bank i later looked at my cellphones history and tried the number i was contacted from after the first complaint i left a message with my name i did not receive a return call but the next day the funds were properly allocated the next paper statement mailed statement states unapplied funds were added on    it continues to state on    the proper amounts were taken from the unapplied funds online the account shows all transactions happening on    in  i made the payment for the normal amount plus  extra principle the check cleared on    i tried calling the number from td banks response again to no avail it was still for   and she never returned my calls i have since lost the other number which may or may not be related it was not until this morning    in which my account has been properly updated maybe it was because i called to inquire about the payoff amount the night before there is no reason in todays technological environment that this should occur in my conversation with  prior to the td bank response to the complaint i inquired on how i can help td bank properly process my payment i was told there was nothing more i could do as filling out the coupon properly does this looking back at my mortgages history i see that back between   i regularly made payments with extra principle they were consistently deposited properly both my online account history and paper statements prove this why has td bank chosen to make this a challenge now my online account has misleadingly said the amount due was  since this issue was supposedly resolved back in  even though the proper amounts were finally distributed today my account still states i owe  on    i will receive my statement in the mail with an amount due soon as i have in the past it will state i own my normal payment as expected why does the website try to deceive me it seems like td bank has a pattern of improperly applying my mortgage payments as instructed it is unfair that i can not seem to avoid this extra effort to ensure this account is serviced properly and in a timely manner i was more than willing and tried repeatedly to contact  instead of continuing this complaint unfortunately that too was fruitless in searching online i have noticed i am not alone others have also had their additional principle put into unapplied funds see https www consumeraffairs com finance td ameritrade html for one example this pattern of unfair and deceptive practices should be stopped","Mortgage"

been a security breach so they were issuing new cards on   i received one of the cards that had been sent to me it was   and left unsecured on my front steps i looked at the card and compared it to the one that it was supposed to replace they had the same expiration date and card number which seemed odd i had fraud on my capital one accounts a few years ago so i called the number on the card to check the balance to make sure everything was ok i rarely use either of my capital one cards and had not used either one in several months so the balance should have been  the balance on that card was  i decided that since i was on the phone id check the balance of my other card which i had not yet received it too should have been  it was several hundred dollars i listened to a list of the most recent charges all of them were from a day or two before at merchants near my house but places that i had never been to i spoke with representative and they sent me to a fraud specialist i explained what had happened they informed me that they i was not responsible for the charges and that they would cancel both cards and send new cards and begin an investigation after thinking about it for a few hours i realized what had happened someone had used my personal information which i know had been leaked because of the fraud on my capital one account years before to order new cards since they had my personal information they also knew my address they waited for the   truck to drop off the first card and took it while i was at work and then immediately went out and started using it the second card which alerted me to the problem arrived on a saturday so i got to it first i called back capital one and explained to them what i thought had happened they assured me that they would include the information in my file and give it to the investigators i also asked them how we could prevent this from happening in the future since whomever stole my identity could pull the same trick again they told me that they would make a note in my file that only calls from my cell phone would considered valid in the future i hung up feeling like they were handling the situation and taking care of me a few days later i received the card to replace the one that had been stole off of my front steps but i never received the one to replace the other card which had also been cancel around    i called again and told the agent that i believed that someone was stealing the cards off of my front step and to cancel that card that i had never received and send a new one but this time not to   but just to mail it so that it would be placed safely into my mail slot around    i received my capital one card bill for the card that had been stolen off of my steps second i had a  dollar charge on it that i had never made and capital one had charged me  dollars to   the card that had been stolen i immediately called them up and explained the whole situation again they told me that the  dollar charge had been made on the card that i had never received and that card was cancelled and i was not liable for it they also reversed the  dollar expedition fee again i felt like they were taking care of the situation on    i received a very cheerful voice message from  who was an investigator with capital one informing me that he had completed his investigation and to call him if he had any questions i had already been assured that i was not liable for any of the fraudulent charges so i did not feel a need to call on    i opened the capital one app to check my credit card balance which i have been doing every few days since the fraudulent activity it was much higher than i expected i locked my card and called capital one again i called them from my work phone and expected them to require me to call them from my cell phone since they had told me that in the future that was how they would verify that it was me and not the person that stole my identity they asked me some basic information that the identity thief knows and then verified that it was me clearly they had made no progress in securing my accounts from further fraud the representative told me that the charges were not new but were old charges that had been put back on i was then transferred to another representative i told her the exact same information that i had told capital one several times before she then transferred me to  who does investigations for capital one i was informed that since the card had a chip and that since the chip was used in the store that  the first investigator had determined that i was lying and that the charges were not fraud and that i was liable for them again for the sixth or seventh time i explained the entire history of events  gave me her number and said that she would reopen the case with the new information when i told her that i had been assured that to avoid future identity theft and fraud they would require me to call on my cell phone she told me that really would not work when i asked how they would prevent the same thing from happening in the future she did not have an answer in summary over two months after i reported the identity theft and fraud i am being told that

"this is related to an inherited ira at bank of america the deceased s name is   the ira account is     i am listed as the beneficiary and have provided all required documentation to have the funds dispersed to an inherited ira that has been opened for the purpose my mom passed away last  leaving multiple boa accounts there were types of accounts first were accounts that i was also on that transferred to my control within just a few days after providing the certificate of death next were a couple of accounts that did not have anyone else listed and did not have a named beneficiary we obtained a court order based on the will addressing those specific accounts and provided the order along with all other requested documentation through a boa branch in  tx the branch faxed the document package to boa s estate department for processing on    it took until   to have those accounts disbursed after months of back and forth to provide additional copies of specific documents that were all provided with the initial document package submitted the last remaining account is the ira that lists me as beneficiary and is not covered by the court order the request for those funds to be dispersed was initially filed with the document package from    since we were having so many problems with boa on the accounts covered by the court order and until those accounts were being distributed i didn t push this account collection until after the other funds were disbursed after the  disbursement of the accounts covered by the court order i began to try to get the ira transferred under the beneficiary designation initially i was told that the estate department no longer handled the ira s and was referred to the bank s ira department they were able to walk me through setting up the ira inheritance account to accept the funds into and assured me that the transfer would occur within a few days and assured me i was the only beneficiary listed on the account when i received the first quarterly statement on the new ira i also received the quarterly statement on my mom s ira they only transferred a small portion of the funds instead of the entire balance the majority of the funds remain in my deceased mother s ira i called the ira department and was told that they don t handle it anymore that the estate department now handles it again they said that i would have a personal representative to take care of me through the process and they were going to have them call me  called a few days later and again told me that he would be my personal contact and would walk me through it since they according to him have been having massive complaints on handling this type of issue the next call with  revealed that he would be passing me off to someone else since it is an ira the new contact was supposed to call me back but i have not heard from them i asked  if i could escalate it since it has been over a year since i originally filed to have the funds disbursed he said no then i asked if i could speak to a supervisor and he said he could have the supervisor   call me the next day i have not received a call from him and my attempts to call him and  just resulted in me leaving voice mail messages my complaint is two fold first is the amount of time and effort involved in getting boa to disburse funds from the accounts my mom had with them was ridiculous i would not be surprised to find out that it is a systemic issue where they have built their processes for the purpose of delaying disbursement of funds so the bank can continue to hold the deposits and make money from investing them if they treat everyone the way they have treated us they are unlawfully keeping people from accessing their funds for extended periods of time and if people are not persistent in pursuing the funds they will keep them until they have to escheat them to the state they never once reached out to us to request anything they claimed they needed and they refused to let us talk to the legal department that was supposedly holding up the claim second the bank continues to hold funds that should have been disbursed to me and my request is that they immediately transfer the remaining funds from my mom s ira account to the inherited ira account they had me set up for the purpose i have been more than patient in working with boa on this and feel that without regulatory intervention it is likely to go on for many more months all relative documentation is on file with boa s estate department","Checking or savings account"

"in  i began the home buying home searching process with rocket mortgage quicken loans as a first time homebuyer i provided every bit of information i was able to my loan officer from the very beginning in regards to my finances income i wanted to be completely transparent with any all information so that i felt confident about the time money i was investing in this process would eventually result in owning a home i was pre approved for an fha loan for which i tried to work with i was told that fha would be the best only option based on my debt to income ratio mostly from student loan debt from my  program but also because of the bankruptcy that was discharged almost years ago with the current housing market it was nearly impossible to find a home for that would pass the required fha home inspection in early mid  i reached out to a different lender loan officer who stated that she   would be able to pre qualify me for more she had been in the business for something like years so i felt really confident that she would be helpful and knowledgeable for me and my situation she pulled my credit worked the numbers and told me i was pre approved for  with an estimated mortgageamount she said that she could go higher but would probably need little more of a down payment she quoted me mortgages for up to  which we stated to also be options if i found something for more i didn t want to go up to  because that mortgage payment was higher than i was comfortable with i did feel more hopeful about finding a home i loved now that i had more flexibility in the my pre approval i found a home with a listing price of right under  that i loved and wanted to make an offer on i contacted my mlo again was told she would send me a pre approval letter to make an offer which she did the offer was accepted we worked closely together to get the loan to her underwriter and were scheduled to close on   on     called me with a little problem the little problem was that she wasnt up to date on fha guidelines regarding student loan payments and that her underwriter had caught her mistake and wouldnt approve my loan from there because my debt to income ratio was too high she stated that she had been counting my actual student loan payment amount on my ibr but that fha now requires counting of of the entire student loan or the amortized payment amount whichever is greater one month before closing the rug was pulled out from underneath me she told me that she re worked the loan amounts all the way down to  which didn t make sense and still couldnt get me approved based on my dti i then reached back out to  to pick back up with the pre approval amount he had previously offered i told him about everything that had happened including that we were a month from closing when her underwriter caught her mistake he told me that he knew that would happen to me as he had been in the business for several years and knew that with my dti i would have to pay some things off before i could be approved for that amount i told him i wanted to pick back up with the pre approval for  or start over again if i had to that i needed to terminate my offer on the house to get my earnest money back he told me to wait that he wanted to talk to his finance manager and see what they could do for me to my surprise he came back with some options that would allow me to continue to closing on this home my options were a co signer which i was adamant was not an option for me pay off my current credit cards and refinance my car to get my payment at or less month i told him i would definitely be able to pay off my credit cards which i did per our agreement would see about refinancing my car which i ended up being able to do but had to take a higher interest rate and pay the loan down by almost on     told me i would need to pay in earnest money to rocket that would be used for the appraisal and any remaining amount would be applied to closing he also told me that if i withdrew the loan before the appraisal was completed i would be refunded the full amount i made the payment by phone that same day per  requirement so that they could go ahead and schedule the appraisal and it cleared from my checking account on   he told me that he was going to go ahead and order the appraisal so that we could stay on track for the    closing my loan went through underwriting and i was issued a conditional approval based on what we discussed to provide them with some additional information documents all of which i provided to them as quickly as possible my realtor and i decided that since the appraisal was going to be completed first we would wait to make sure that the house appraised before ordering the other inspections needed to ensure that i wasnt paying for services all at once to ensure they passed at this time my application file was passed on from  to a new rocket mortgage associate  from this point on things become a nightmare we were now upon a holiday week    so i was understanding of things slowing somewhat knowing that people vacation too much time started passing though and it didnt feel like things were progressing with my loan my realtor decided that to ask for an extension on the due diligence period to give rocket more time to get things done it was requested granted and the new due diligence period was now effective until   at  est and the new closing was   at  est my realtor also requesting updates from rocket informed me that on    after speaking with  at rocket she was told that the appraisal had not even been scheduled i called on that same day to speak with  to request that things move faster i was told that the appraisal had not been scheduled because the appraiser hadnt called back but that it was ordered on  over a week after i was told it would be scheduled i was assured we would still have the report back by    by this point i m nervous i requested after days of getting rocket team members saying that the appraisal company that was hired wasnt returning their calls or emails they hire a different appraiser to complete the appraisal since we were running out of time but was told that was not a possibility i then asked that it be expedited  stated that he would look into it after being reviewed  called and told me that the appraisal had actually been completed and he requested to get the report by    none of this was making sense dates and info provided to me were all over the place that same evening my realtor called me to follow up that she talked to  who said the appraisal was scheduled for    at  completely conflicting with the information he gave me earlier on    i called  at   to request that we receive the report by the end of the day since the latest update was that the appraisal had been done that morning at  in attempt to be back on track he was confused and stated that the appraisal had been done before    but again that hed look into it at this point i requested to speak with a supervisor and was put into contact with   informed me that could not force the appraiser to get the report faster and that there was nothing they could do i acknowledged understanding that people are busy and can not just stop everything for me but that i had been patient and understanding up to this point i told him i was frustrated by the delay from his team in even ordering the appraisal to begin with  then informed me that they cant request an appraisal until after a case number was assigned because its an fha loan so they had to see if any other appraisals had been done on the property that could be used which was new information to me and sounded like another excuse i informed him that i had requested a different appraiser but was told that wasnt an option i also had also asked what their back up plan was in situations like this and was told there wasnt one  told me that he would personally stay on top of it i didnt hear from him i reached out and couldnt get ahold of  and didnt have  direct contact info at this point it felt like rocket employees were making more of an effort to make excuses that to acknowledge that they dropped the ball or to pick the ball back up and move forward i was getting no info unless i reached out and even then that info was untrue inaccurate at this point i paid for a service that i can not even get confirmation on has been rendered i have also paid been invoiced for many other services inspections fees that ive had to complete in order to not hold the process up on my end the goal for me was always to close on my home by this point i had spent countless hours trying to get info from rocket regarding the status and jumping through hoops to get all the requested documentation to rocket even documents were requested multiple times as if they were not even being read reviewed    my call was never returned i called again around   was unavailable so i was routed to the next available team member i expressed my frustration and said that i need the appraisal report that i was promised and then denied told its going to take more time he read the notes in my account and said oh it looks like its not due back until    so were fine no that is incorrect most recently before today i was told it would be back today today came and now youre telling me the  he asked me if i had been in contact with my realtor yes every step of the way he then told me that rocket has nothing to do with appraisals that i would need to speak with my realtor about it again incorrect info by rocket that is incorrect i was told on    that i had to pay rocket so they could get the appraisal scheduled asap which i did eventually my request to speak with  was granted he told me they still hadnt heard back from the appraisal company and that hed give me a status update in the morning he then asked how my name was to appear on the title deed if   was correct it was supposed to be    as originally discussed and that    would also be on the deed which was also discussed in the beginning he said that he would make those changes to get that updated as well apparently rocket hadnt put the correct information on the deed     did call me to update me he told me we still havent heard back and our entire team will be out of the office the rest of the day another day would be lost in this process i asked why its gotten to this point why they dont have a back up plan with they work with a rd party that keeps rocket from servicing their customers in a timely manner he said that if he had been on this issue before this week he would have looked into having someone else do the appraisal i told him that i had asked early on in the process for a different appraiser to be assigned because from the beginning i have been told that there has been little to no response from the appraiser i told him i was told that hiring a different appraiser was not an option he said he could try to assign another appraiser now but it would further delay the process i told him paid for one appraisal that didn t happen and i couldn t pay for another he offered me good news that he cleared up the confusion regarding the paperwork that i had submitted and resubmitted and resubmitted so that was all taken care of he then asked me my relation to  and i told him she was my fianc he ended with telling me that hed provide an update before leaving the office for the team event that he would be at for the rest of the day     called back a few minutes after hanging up to say he would have to send the title request to add  name to it and wait for it to come back that it might take a little while i asked for clarification so were going to have to wait on this now too because it wasnt submitted correctly the first time i told him that her name was to be on the deed and that if it meant taking a little while then thats what we would do as to ensure that both names were on the deed    that evening  and i made several attempts to get the contact information of the appraisal company which nobody had access to everyone who apparently had access to that information was at a company baseball game for the entire afternoon  left  a voicemail to loop him in on this situation since he was the first contact that started this process     called me back per the voicemail that  left he stated that he was confused about why nobody has any info for us but he didnt have access to the contact information of the appraisal company either he apologized and told me he was sending out an email to everyone involved at rocket as well as the director to get an answer today i asked him to verify the dates that it was ordered for me he stated that he sent the request to his team to order the appraisal on  but that my account notes that it was picked up by a company on    i asked him to clarify what that meant and if that meant that it wasnt requested by rocket to an appraiser until the  he could not give me that information he asked me when the appraisal had been done and i informed him that nobody can confirm it has actually been completed after several different dates were given to me as to when i would have the report back it was then stated to me that the appraisal was scheduled for monday     i told  that im not sure that that even took place because if his team members had been reaching out as often and diligently as i was being told with no success in reaching someone at the appraisal company then there was no way they would know that the appraisal was taking place on the  at  i told him that i was confused as to where that would have come from if they havent been able to reach the appraisal company  mentioned that in certain instances an expedited appraisal can be ordered i stated that if that was an option why wasnt it offered to me earlier    when i hung up with  i called  when i told him my name he chuckled as if to mock me i didn t react but stated i needed the contact information of the appraisal company so that i could follow up with them myself given nobody at rocket could manage to make that happen he said that they dont know who the appraiser was that they dont have access to contact the appraiser i asked for clarification really then who have you been supposedly reaching out to for answers he said they work with a rd party who schedules the appraisal i asked for their contact information to connect the dots myself and he stated he didnt have that contact info for me either he stated he would get that information for me follow back up with me shortly he said he d call me in minutes that was at  at  i still had not received a callback if they have been reaching out to someone as frequently and i m told how can there be no contact info to access     i called  back to get the contact info he said he was still working on it i asked why how it was proving to be so hard to locate this info he then said that he didnt contact them i reminded him that he told me he had been making attempts to reach out and asked him if that was a lie he said that he had but was trying to figure out the best contact person enough with the lies i need any contact person from the appraisal management company that rocket works with he gave me   and stated the company was  her number is      i called   and left a voicemail her voicemail provided the backup contact information for   at  i called him and didnt reach him either so i dialed to speak with the next available client relations team specialist i was connected to   she confirmed the appraisal was completed on    she stated it was ordered on  and picked up on by an appraiser  on    on     confirmed that he would complete the appraisal on     also informed me that because rocket is a partner they have access to their system as well as to all of the same information that she was providing to me she stated that the appraiser had not returned the report yet but that they had requested to get it about an hour ago all of the info i have been fighting for from rocket during the past weeks was provided in phone call to      i called  for an update after sending an email to  and  rocket requesting an update i spoke to   who informed me that there still was no report on file she transferred me to rocket quicken and i spoke to a person named   confirmed my info to access my account gave me no information and passed me along to a  who did not answer my phone call i left a voicemail       called to say there was still no report i asked what im supposed to do now he said i assure you that were doing everything we can to get this report i explained that i understand theyre doing everything today but that that should have been the case for the entire weeks that ive been waiting he said he could try to get another appraiser that same day i told him that that was not going to be a helpful solution when it still wasnt going to get me a report in enough time to negotiate if what needed by the following day at  when due diligence ended note on this phone call  explained to me that the notes in my record now stated that the completion date for the appraisal as of  was scheduled for    on    that completion date was changed to    on    the completion date was changed to    and now the completion date is scheduled for the same day of            called to tell me that i needed to pay off more debt to get my dti under because of new information they received about a mortgage request that was denied i told him that was incorrect that that was not new information he said so our team knew that there had been another loan not go through yes that was absolutely disclosed and discussed before any of this started i told him that i had been informed that in order to qualify for the loan i would need to pay off my credit card debts and refi my car to get my payment under  month which i did almost a month ago he said they would not be able to approve the loan unless i paid off my car or got a cosigner i was shocked and speechless i told him that i couldn t talk to him now i would call him back i was at work and panicking i was now being told that i had wasted a month of time and resources to make this happen only for rocket to decide a week and days before closing that they wont do the loan now    i called  to see what was going on after some investigating he concluded that  at   had not just denied me in underwriting with  but had also submitted the loan application to fha as well who then also denied me but never shared any of that information with me i was told that because fha denied me i would be unable to apply for another fha loan for days i wasnt informed of this by  and rocket failed check that i had not already been assigned an fha case number which from what i was learning meant that they would have then known i had been denied by fha and not just   acknowledged that rocket failed to do what should have been done as well as with letting the appraisal drag out for so long that he would refund me the deposit i paid to have the appraisal done if after speaking with   first thing friday morning he concluded there was no other option to proceed it never should have gotten to this point and i never should have even paid that the i paid for the inspection that im now told i wont be recouping the other fees assessed which i am providing invoices for as i receive them or the i had tied up in earnest money     called at  to confirm that the only options to proceed would be to pay my debts down another in addition to the other debts ive already paid off per our agreement about k at the end of  or add a cosigner which i stated from the beginning was not an option now im out a ton of money have wasted an unfathomable amount of time and it was all for nothing i can t believe that this could happen i feel there has been no truth in lending from rocket mortgage i wanted clarification but got answers that went in circles when i asked questions i started researching what my options were and what fha guidelines were    after researching fha guidelines as recommended by another lender that i know it came to my attention that rocket had once again provided false inaccurate information particularly regarding fha guidelines it was now my understanding that fha case numbers are assigned to properties not borrowers and that the case number can be transferred from one lender to another at the new lenders request it was also now my understanding that the fha case number once assigned sticks with the property not the borrower and should the borrower not close the fha case number would then be assigned to a new fha borrower if someone tried to purchase the home with an fha loan within a required time period or else the case number would expire i emailed   the solutions consultant who called me on thursday to inform me that they were no longer financing my loan for clarification  called me instead of responding to my email because it was easier he stated that i had an fha case number assigned to me as well as one assigned to the property and that because i was denied by the previous lender they had to review my case upon reviewing they determined i now had to have a lower debt to income ratio or a cosigner and a credit score over which i have i asked so to clarify thats rockets policy and not fha guidelines he said that he would give me the number to the client relations team if i had additional questions i didnt want to be punted to another department since he was the one who had given this information to me originally i stated that i was told that was provided the fha guidelines from him last week and that he informed me that this was why i would not be eligible for days he stated that just because i qualified for fha did not mean that they had to finance me which i did not contest i informed him that my argument was that because it was presented as fha guidelines it was not presented to me that i had any other options i e contacting a different lender and i had to terminate my offer before due diligence ended the following day as not to lose my earnest money he still never responded to my question asking why i was told i would have to wait days to apply for another fha loan as i was asking for clarifications between fha guidelines and rocket policies  interrupted me and was talking over me telling me that he could not speak to fha guidelines only rockets and that if i needed questions answered about that that i could contact client relations for assistance i stated that if he was providing me the information that i was denied per fha and that if they were lending on fha insured loans that he should have accurate fha guideline information for customers and that i was frustrated that i had been provided incorrect information yet again i told him that i didnt need to speak with client relations that i was tired of being punted from team to team with different information each time that it was very apparent that i wasnt given accurate information again and that i was going to escalate this case and thanked him for his time    i sent emails to  asking him for clarification as to what non self employed income not supported meant and stated that i reached out to him since the letter was signed with his name he told me that he didnt know what  told me on the phone about the denial and couldnt tell me what the non self employed income not supported meant either he said that it was a generic letter that they send out he said that he reached out to  to call me but that  was out of the office until    i told him that  had not been able to answer my questions regarding fha guidelines previously but only tried to punt me to client relations and therefore having him call me would probably result in the same outcome he told me that to his knowledge the fha case number was assigned to me and the property i informed him that it was my understanding that it was assigned to the property and that the fha case number transfers with the property not the person he stated that he was unsure of the fha policy but again would have  call me i explained my frustration with the information that was given to me being inaccurate and that the denial that  originally mentioned was because the other lender didnt approve my loan they had to review my loan which at that time decided that in order to proceed with my loan rocket would require me to pay my debt down to under and have a credit score of at least i believe was the number he gave me which my credit score was well above rockets documentation dated    from     states that my credit score was a  well above the required minimum credit score for fha after doing everything i was required to do to meet the fha debt to income ratio of being under which i was told my rocket would clear me for a final approval rocket decided after a month into the process that i now had to meet completely different requirements and then was telling me that it was fha denying me the previous lender denied me because she didnt have accurate information on fha guidelines which were caught by her underwriter rocket was made completely aware of this from the beginning instructed me on how much debt would need to be paid off to be under fhas and that i would be good to go rocket went against all of what i had been told despite doing exactly as i was required to do blamed it on fha policy and yet stated with their sudden and new requirements that if i had a cosigner or paid down the additional of my debt that i could continue with the fha loan it makes no sense the stories arent cohesive from one contact at rocket to the next and when i ask questions nobody can seem to provide that information and punts me to someone on the client relations team if a letter is sent on someones behalf in this case  and even if it is in fact a generic letter that person named on the letter should absolutely be able to accurately explain the contents of that letter additionally if the denial reason is what they say it is then there should be no need for interpretation from another person  who couldnt answer my questions previously either who wont even be in the office for another days to the next person working on the same loan application i had emailed  as to not engage in another discussion at work regarding all of this personal information but again i receive a phone call in response to an email that needed a simple response to a simple question for clarification which rocket team members could not provide during this same conversation with  the denial reason also shifted from rocket stating that i had been denied by another lender who reported the denial to fha to i was denied the loan by fha i again asked for clarification and reminded  that he and i had discussed that  underwriter had denied to loan when i spoke with him from the beginning i clarified that he was now telling me that fha denied me which was not the information i had been given by  that he was now blaming me for withholding information about i had not heard anything about being denied by anyone except fha until rocket all of a sudden telling me that it was denied by fha and also telling me that it was only denied by  but it was then reported to fha i have so many concerns and issues with how this has played out and how i have been treated and misinformed and dare i say blatantly lied to by rocket mortgage im completely at a loss and im truly unsure of who to contact to resolve this i have kept thorough documentation throughout and will supply any documentation needed","Mortgage"

"to whom tis may concern my complaint is in regards to the comenity bank and all associated credit cards that they deal with up until recently between both me and my husband   we had over credit cards in good standing with comenity and paid to them on time in    my bank    had a cyber issue that froze our auto payment accounts the resolution of getting the bank to release the funds and fix the payments went on for months in reaction and concern for all my bills i sent out the bank generated letter to all involved which included comenity bank comenity bank started with one account already open and i believe it was  checked on my credit and decided to cut down my credit then they went on to the next account after that one was done and cut that credit down way below what i still owed implying that i was buying above my means and my debt ratio credit report was severely affected by it they continued to do this and caused a debt ratio issue using the credit report agency as their reasoning for or it for instance i owed   around dollars and they cut my credit limit down to  after checking my credit and using the report which was their credit cards they pointed out they caused the report issue as a justification to do that i sent in complaints to the companies comenity and credit reports i sent in the documentation from the bank and copies of the letters from comenity justifying their actions at least five credit cards were cut down was significantly done below the amount due thus making it look like we don t pay our bills or live beyond our means up until that hiccup that was not our fault we had ongoing payments and on time in other words they owned the credit cards and bills to the accounts that caused this domino effect and did nothing about it their justification was the reporting agency which they reported the information to that justified their actions since we could not pay everything at once off and they screwed up our credit to even look at a consolidated loan pay off i turned to a credit repair company to stop the consistent deductions of credit limits that was ongoing i would pay down a bill and they would reciprocate in making the limit even lower in addition payments were arranged which caused according to comenity to close all the accounts since they insisted using   would make them do that as part of the agreement closing accounts is a bad thing for credit history i would have simply paid them down as usual and off in the mean time i sent all of this to   whom was working on removing a few negative items from my reports and they did absolutely nothing about comenity s actions with the exception of  not completed yet none of the other reporting agencies have acted upon or investigated especially with providing proper documentation of what was being done and what was provided in the end of the investigation they just left my credit report as is and not force results with these creditors i was ultimately set up to have my credit ruined by comenity bank having a reply that they investigated and found it to be right okay prove it comenity bank has mixed rules some accounts do not report with one day issue and others do in addition i asked for help with the late fees some did few and some didn t help me last their actions have caused issues with my job since my and my husband s credit report is looked upon for employment i made that clear to all involved i could lose my job this was many accounts i have very few other cards so the ratio destroyed my credit did comenity bank s as a reaction to my informing them of the bank glitch lower my credit limit way below the original limit and the amount owed legal it happened right after i notified them i believe it was spiteful and deliberate to hurt my credit their reaction was in my opinion targeted i asked them since they closed the accounts due to  involvement to put the credit limits back that would help my credit score and reports while they are paid off no reply no resolution now according to  report they make it look like it was at that amount the past months the report is highly incorrect for all of the accounts past credit limits were falsely adjusted to reflect the current limit not showing they dropped the credit limits recently they should be stricken from my reports for deliberately reporting false information i am sure this is going on with the other three credit reports last by law i demanded they provide proof of the reported information and documents to justify it i should not have to give it to them as their consistent generic generated reply letters state they prove the accuracy of their reports or remove the information at once i sent letter since at least    until present comenity bank ignores me and at least two of the credit report agencies reply that they investigated the issue but do not provide proof from the creditors on what was reported and the documented conclusions of their findings i just simply receive an updated report with the same information on it i went from being a stellar customer for years and it turned to having them ruin my life this could effectively make me lose my job this was presented to me during my reinvestigation i was in shock i let them know it effects my job i pay them and will pay what is owed they should make good with their actions they cut my credit to force me to pay them faster and i can t do that i had multiple late fees to pay on top of all the issues caused by the incident that started it all in    please enforce the law on not only the actions lack of reactions but also how this has affected my life and financial history i am very upset over my future and never saw this coming i am not a dirt bag consumer i pay my bills on time and to the best of my ability they will be paid what why and how do they get away with all of this last recently comenity has made sure they added credit cards missing from other reports were just added to the credit

and faxed the paystubs and other information he asked for to get the payment arrangement process set up he confirmed that the fax was received and would be processed he said that they couldn t read my

arrangement with  and  was noted reflecting that i no longer wanted a hearing the next day i confirmed that the paystubs were received by your firm on    i confirmed with  that i wanted to set up a

word then on    i received an email from my employer stating that my wages are being garnished no one ever informed me that the paperwork wasn t accepted no one every followed up i have been willing to get into a payment arrangement since    all the calls are documented and recorded there are calls since that date explicitly asking for this i have spent over hours on the phone trying to resolve this so that a garnishment was never on my record as a result i filed a formal complaint with the department of education just as a follow up i called again on    and spoke to  he asked me when i was making a payment i told him that i m waiting for the paperwork that i was told was necessary to start the process i told him my frustrations with the system and i told him that i was told it would be reviewed by  or  the director and assistant director respectively he said he d put me through to his manager i said don t waste my time i want those two specific people he put  on the line i told

to be removed from credit report collection costs are charged every month and request that the garnishment stops after months  is contact number  month in addition to garnishment i also have documented conversations with   last week because   told me during our conversation that a supervisor would review the recorded conversations to resolve this garnishment this garnishment affects my job this affects my personal and public record i made every effort within my power to prevent this from happening it has not only caused me tremendous anxiety and stress it impacts my job and my family i have been willing to rehabilitate this loan and you have those conversations documented i was never even given a written warning about the garnishment in advance i assumed that your firm was upholding it s portion of this agreement that we made verbally a fair resolution to this problem is to have the garnishment permanently removed from my record including my credit and that information should be forwarded to my employer it should also be permanently removed from my u through finra this error is a processing error by your firm it was not because of me or my lack of trying to work with you it is unethical and you have used deceptive practices to start this collection process with my employer which is illegal under the fair debt collection practices act furthermore this i still have never seen the actual accounting for this loan you don t own it the department of education does these loans date back to  and no original documents and or accounting has been provided to verify the charges for them from  to  i was never even able to logon to see the accounts due to a name change and a glitch in the fsaid system no statements were ever sent after  so i had no written

"on thursday   i opened a high yield investor checking account at charles schwab bank in the amount of      said account was immediately opened then funded with absolutely no requirements of me and no restrictions i was immediately sent a   card and checks that i did not ask for had i been asked i would have refused because  cards can not or do not fully accomodate my full lawful legal name i never allow my name to be truncated and normally i would sue  and win because i never asked  for anything but i decided to skip that drama shred the card and close said account until people do what i tell them to do regarding my money and my life i thought i finally would be treated with a modicum of respect when i opened an account at charles schwab bank they made me feel safe and i even referred my mother as a family member so charles schwab bank could become trustee over my trust however i quickly realized charles schwab bank s treament of me was all a fasad and once again i was trapped between a living nightmare and the twilight zone my logic is easy plain and simple that even a little child can understand it and understand that no means no i told charles schwab bank stop apologizing to me after they learned i m a     survior living through the aftermath of brutal  and   for said reason i don t have to comply with anything they ve demanded of me after the fact emphasis on after the fact i respectfully accept and understand anyone s regulations and rules about anything but i stated my money is mine and you can not keep it have it or take it because i have my own federal laws regulations and rules that i must and do abide by and live by everyday that keep me safe as a     survior i am not difficult with anyone i am straightforward and truthful always but as i stated to   the verification department at charles schwab bank on tuesday   there is a part of my life they will never access because it is sealed in one aspect and behind a locked vault in another i stated i don t care if they accept that but they have to atleast respect that because it will never change and i will never change so just give me back all my money i don t expect partiality or preferential treatment regarding what has happened to me in my past because i don t have a victim s mentality however i do have a problem with charles schwab bank receving me as a client with open arms and then afterwards demanding i comply with something that i would have never consented to in order to become their client in the first place i did not consent to give them anything more after the fact trying to force me to comply to anything and retalitating against me when i don t or won t never works on me it never has and it never will if you try to circumvent the federal laws that were made to protect me and my annoymity then you are going to be in for one  of a fight because i m not going to stand for it nor will i tolerate it all i want is my money back and to not have anymore dealings with charles schwab bank for the rest of my natural life i m going to reach out to the  movement and   about what is happening to me over and over and over again with no justification for it whatsoever but to aid assist and help that                my elderly mother to get to me in the process charles schwab bank with intentional willful malice bounced  checks i made to   funded my last round of   medications and my mother and i have had a wonderful relationship with  for nearly  years this was extremely disheartening for me to know charles schwab bank dishonered both payments when i ve made every payment to  and never late once on tuesday   i opened up a chat and spoke with  requesting a  or supervisor in account closings she refused to escalate said chat then transferred me to their verification department instead i closed said chat and gave her a survey score of all zeros i informed someone named  in the charles schwab bank verification department that i received a letter on tuesday   at  pm from said department with demands of me with an imminent deadline addressed to me with my lawful legal name mispelled i made a decision to close said account because anyone asinine and or incomptent as   to misspell my name from a verfication department will never be allowed to deal with and or handle my financial money affairs i am forever unforgiving of any instance of tampering with my lawful legal name because that is the epitome of where felony fraud begins and it always ends with full blown identity theft i received alot of apologies on tuesday   from charles schwab bank associates after i revealed i can t conform to anyonelse s deadlines about anything except my own due to    and everything i do has to be booked and or scheduled with a third party person and driver on their time not mine i demanded my money back and going forward i just won t put anymore of it in any financial institution because they befriend me then they betray me the instance i attempt to use my own money for medical reasons charles schwab bank locked and froze my account knowing full well i will never give them anything more than what they asked for in their application but anything else after the fact never come  or come high water no one at said foregoing address is going to communicate with charles schwab bank any further except via legal retained counsel for punitive damages thank you kindly your immediate attention careful consideration and full cooperation in this matter is greatly appreciated charles schwab bank may withold a   delivery fee from said remitted

"it has come to my attention that equifax will no longer be giving consumers their rightly owed money as a matter of financial practicality i believe that not only is this immoral but that the ftc and other consumer representative bodies should step in and further penalize equifax this is primarily the case for three reasons one consumers never co wanted to the financialization and indexing of their habits by way of banks and other parties interested in exploiting them credit scores credit ratings and other abstract instruments are tools of an oppressive capitalist class and do not protect our interests second it is also the case that consumers have been robbed of their privacy because of equifaxes gross negligence finally workers have seen no real wage increases and thus rather than opt for protection they wanted cash this need for liquid assets is directly linked to speculative markets and the creation of new debt mechanisms which equifax and their ilk directly profit from by collecting interest from already strapped consumers so pretty please with sugar on top do your  job","Debt collection"

"i recently refinanced in    with my then current lender  with a first payment scheduled for    mid    i received a letter about my new loan being sold to   with servicing done by arvest central mortgage in that time i received one letter from  explaining the transfer and one letter from   today is my first payment and after sorting through who to pay i was able to create an account with arvest on their website mind you i have not received a statement nor a coupon book from arvest my only option for payment of the mortgage included a  fee upon attempting to set up automatic payments for future transaction which was fully available with  their website fails to set up the transaction i attempted calling customer service and said their website was down they told me that it was aware of the problem and was working on it further research on the internet further shows however that this has been the case for at least months with the exception of a couple star reviews nearly every arvest review is one star with a complaint about the charges for online and phone payments plus the website being broken for the establishment of recurring payments i spoke with the  agent and they said there was little they could do at this point other than not sell to that vendor i contacted   and was told that a reassignment of servicer couldn t be initiated by a consumer when i explained my situation and asked for arvest to be investigated for predatory practices gouging on fees and making things difficult to set up auto payment most likely to increase payment fees and late fees my case was escalated where i was told there was nothing they could do during the escalation that credit companies are supervised by the cfpb you i also called arvest back and requested speaking to a supervisor he acted like he didn t know the website was broken and lied straight to my face about it i told him he must either be new or that he s lying because i had read the past months of reviews online in places like  he insisted again that he had worked there for years and that he needed my information to verify his website was broken i am certain with one look at places like  or other online reviewing agencies no consumer in their right mind would ever pick arvest further with reviews mentioning the random account fees the bad cust service the always broken website and the extreme hassle no sane consumer would stick with arvest central i am lodging a complaint first at arvest because they are out there only to gouge people they never sent me a statement never sent a coupon book this is my first payment with them and i am gouged  to make a payment online or on phone and i am not alone next they obviously don t meet the qualifications for a   lender or the   regulations are so dated as to be worthless if they can not maintain a website far enough to allow a form to enter account information to actually take automated payments they are obviously more interested in collecting the fees from late and non payment that their system provides but further i am lodging my complaint at the inability to change servicers on request not only is arvest in the words of one  review the worst of the worst i was forced into this servicer with absolutely zero choice foreknowledge nor resolution arvest is piece of garbage business wise and everything from their customer service to their website shows it clearly the only reason they are still in business is that consumers the people that the cfpb is supposed to be protecting hasn t audited them allows them to continue business and because   solicits their service in a free market they would have been shut down years ago with bad reviews going back at least to    no other busineds in a free economy allows consumers like me and the many others like those on  exists where consumers buy a product from one vendor and then are sold to another inferior garbage racket that likes straight to you charges exorbitant fees simply to line the pockets and gives the consumer literally zero recourse it is ridiculous it is criminal that this company is allowed to exist and simply rob from people who bought legitimate mortgages from legitimate vendors who actually care about their customers it is doubly so that i as a consumer have zero recourse when it comes to this if they wanted to charge a  transaction fee then what  i would have to pay it because i bought a mortgage and the first time i caught a company lying to me straight away let alone twice in a day it wohld be the end of it and whose interest is it in that i can t change it theirs they don t have to provide a single service fix a single website or do anything else because they know i can t request a change please investigate arvest central mortgage and don t listen to their lies about we don t know or were working on it they re not  proves they haven t fixed a thing in at least months and fire them because as the current mortgage laws go i can t and i would have by now and it s only my first day it is ridiculous to think that this company should be afforded any protection at all because i as the consumer in good faith embarking on a year

"on    equifax announced that it had discovered a cyber security breach had occurred earlier that year exposing over   users data to hackers on friday    i learned of a class action lawsuit that would entitle those whose data had been stolen to receive just compensation from equifax whose lax and careless security practices failed to protect the precious data entrusted to it i filed the claim for compensation as directed on this website https www equifaxbreachsettlement com file a claim then today    i learned that the response to the class action filing process has been as they said overwhelming and that only  of the already paltry  settlement had been allotted to payouts to those affected by the breach so instead of receiving up to in compensation the total cash payout divided equally across all claimants will be minuscule if they had to pay the full per affected individual it would cost roughly https www ftc gov enforcement cases proceedings refunds equifax data breach settlement the alternative being offered is for equifax to offer years of free credit reporting which is fine but hardly a way to punish a massive company for their depraved disregard for customer privacy how will we keep these credit bureaus honest if the only penalties they incur for incompetence and indifference is so small as to be a veritable slap on the wrist they ll just see it as the cost of doing business and will continue to be criminally negligent actors in the finance space as your admirable stated mission is to write and enforce rules that keep banks and other financial companies operating fairly i think the cfpb should be alarmed and appalled by this turn of events equifax is essentially paying no price for their negligence and they are shifting the burden of dealing with the consequences of the data breach onto the victims as citizens in st century america affected consumers have little choice but to participate in the credit bureaus game but the power is ludicrously unequally distributed agencies like the cfpb are one of the few levers by which ordinary citizens can apply pressure to these huge power brokers i would like to see the cfpb take whatever actions are possible to ensure that equifax and other credit bureaus are forced to protect the consumer data with which they are entrusted now and in the future thank you","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

"i made a purchase at      for the amount of on  i financed through comenity and signed up for the months interest finance plan shortly after creating an online account a representative helped me setup automatic payments to pay my plan in full see confirmation email below no stamps no late payments no worries i managed my account through the online portal customer dashboard noticing the payments were correctly being displayed and applied to the plan that i signed up for i am writing to dispute a balance in the amount of on my account this is the amount of accrued interest i received after my last payment of was taken out of my account according to comenitys automatic payment plan days after the month promotional plan i had signed up for i believe the penalty of the full accrued interest on the original purchase amount is unfair and erroneous due to the discrepancy between the automatic payment schedule and the promotional expiration date as well as the lack of communication and alerts comenity provides to inform customers of this inconsistency after speaking with a customer service representative on    the day i received an email for a new statement including the accrued interest penalty billed    i was informed that the billing cycle might extend past the promotional date and on the billing statements there is a disclaimer printed in small red lettering stating the discrepancy between these two i explained to several customer support members that i was not receiving this information and that this message is not stated meaningfully and clearly on the website or through any other avenues of communication emails text messages secure message center i was appalled at the deceiving structure of the automatic payment schedule it is not in the customers best interest to have a default payment plan setup to have them fail at paying their full balance by the end of the promotional term to which they signed up for for a system completely created and organized by comenity it is deceptive and negligent to have the default minimum monthly payment less than required in order to pay the full account balance by the end of the promotional terms the term automatic payment should and does not equate or extrapolate to manually having to change the payment amount in order to meet the promotion deadline unbeknownst at the time of signing up comenity roles out a payment plan schedule that runs into the th month which is one month past a customers promotional period of an month promotional plan it must be understood by comenity that customers are trusting that their services are setup fairly and honestly and with intent to make their customers happy and satisfied customers do not know what they dont know upon signing up for a promotional plan and therefore are relying on customer services to successfully guide them through the process comenity should be required to provide customers with a payment plan that matches their promotional period even taking into account a processing period the default minimum automatic payment amount should be increased by comenity in order to pay the entire account balance prior to the th month or customers should receive a statement with the remaining account balance the month prior to the promotional end date it is because of these flaws and gaps in comenitys business methods why i as a loyal and honest paying customer am experiencing such frustration much of which employees on comenitys side seem to understand agree with and be all too familiar with its these reasons why i am very dissatisfied with the services provided to me by comenity and i only see it right for comenity to do everything in their power to make reasonable accommodations adjustments my experiences with customer service have been disappointing and irresolute having over five conversations with team members multiple comenity representatives expressed their sympathy agreeing with the above statements ive outlined one or two members have told me they would reverse the penalty on my account if they could but unfortunately they do not have the proper authority to which i requested i be transferred to the next manager that could customer service representatives claim to add notes to my account detailing each conversation however each new phone call is at least another ten to fifteen minutes having to explain the situation up front which is very redundant and time consuming this is not quality customer care at the end of my discussion with  an account manager on friday    he admitted that the system is misleading and not set up for customers to succeed in meeting their promotional deadlines he expressed how sorry he felt for my wife and me and wished he had the authority to adjust this penalty after hearing this i requested that i speak with a higher manager after which  transferred me to a senior account manager  id  i had a brief discussion with  explaining my confusion and disagreement regarding the accrued interest charge applied to my account she acknowledged the issue and told me that she would reach out to the dispute team to clear this up due to business hours she said she would have to follow up with me at a later date she told me that she would give me a call around  my time in wisconsin monday    i verified my phone number with her and she provided her id number in the event that there were any disconnections in communication i never received a call back monday the  i followed up by calling again tuesday    where i spoke with another representative who told me that i was providing erroneous information regarding any scheduled call back and explained that comenity representatives managers dont typically schedule calls i was not pleased with this inconsistent information being told to me between representatives i requested to be transferred to another manager i talked to  id  who apologized for the inconvenience and said she sent a message to  who she confirmed to be in the office that day after a few minutes  told me that  was busy at the moment but that she would personally follow up with  regarding my call and either her or  would follow

"suntrust is making it very difficult for a consumer to remove the escrows from their mortgage the department who handles the escrows is a phantom department you can only communicate with via fax they say it takes weeks for someone to contact you no one ever does one has to call back to get answers the big issues is they will only remove escrow once the loan to value ratio of the property is but the value they use is the price of the home when it was first purchased which is not representative of the current value of the home now given market appreciation this does not make any sense if the home values where lower than when one first bought the home i bet they would not do the calculations based on the purchase price of the home i am pretty sure this is a violation of consumer rights and protection laws this even applies to consumers who want to have their pmi s removed in that case the consumer would be tied to the pmi until their loan is actually of the value of the home which given real estate market fluctuations this could very well play out to the detriment of the consumer who may not be able to remove their pmi s for a very long time they are clearly manipulating the law and using the rules to their convenience and controlling our money in their escrow accounts if they are making it difficult for consumers to remove their escrows in good financial times with a healthy real estate market they can cause home owners to lose their homes during harsh economic times because they are tying the escrows to the mortgage and not allowing the homeowners to remove them","Mortgage"

detailing our situation and providing copies of my personal and federal tax returns    replied the same day requesting that i complete and send various documents and stating our prequals usually come back within hours i was then asked to send additional information directly to  which i provided in a timely manner ensuring all the requested information was included  informed me that i was an ideal fit for their business and asked that i continue the formal application process via a broker i worked with   at   to complete submit my  application and provide all supporting documentation during this period i spent a great deal of time identifying and negotiating a property and on the basis of assurances from  i entered into a purchase contract with a closing date of the    which was subsequently changed to the  both acc mortgage and  were fully aware of the contract dates having been provided with a copy of the contract and addendum  informed me that the company would love to provide me with a mortgage and was completely confident that i would be provided with the loan in a speedy and efficient manner at no time was i informed there was any issue with my application or that the contract closing date would be missed   by this date i had given notice to my landlord and was due to vacate by the end of the month however it became clear that the lender was intentionally delaying the completion of the mortgage i emailed  directly as i had just seen statements in an email stating that they now require hours to review any conditions and further that they required days with conditions satisfied before closing this information was a footnote on an email to  and had never been disclosed to me before having received no reply to my urgent message i called  to find out what was happening she then informed me that she was unable to talk to me as it was a respa violation for her to talk directly to a customer and that she would lose her licence if she continued i believe this is a blatant lie she then hung up on me and refused any further calls during the entire process i provided every item of information requested in a timely manner however it became clear after the contractual closing date had passed that acc were intentionally stalling by requesting un specific changes to a p l statement often contradicting their own requests unless i am much mistaken i believe that the company may have been waiting for additional funding before proceeding with further loans and were stalling until such time as they had received them or they were completely incompetent which i find just as likely despite issuing all of the documents listed below the company continually requested changes to the format and signatories to the p l account eventually and some two weeks after contract closing date a new underwriter was appointed and suggested we may be able to close very soon however they required an extension from the seller it should be noted that this person i believe she is the senior vp of the company stated that the broker should ignore everything that the previous underwriters had told him as it was completely wrong and simply to follow her instructions i also believe that the previous underwriter was subsequently fired from the company but can not confirm this   was told this on numerous occasions both the broker and i requested acc to provide us with the format or a template of exactly what they required for the p l also requested from the ceo so that we could bypass the continual back and forth process of rejecting them this was never forthcoming and we continued to receive vague and inaccurate instructions see example provided to   the ceo of acc mortgage it should be noted here that acc finally required a p l prepared by our cpa which is identical to the document we provided several weeks earlier and which was rejected by the acc underwriter as too complicated the rejection of this original document was followed by demands for several iterations of a p l signed by me by my cpa prepared by me include or relocate additional data etc at this stage the seller and their attorneys were unable to accept anything that acc had to say after we were informed the file was in final underwriting the closer called the underwriter directly and was told that he had not even seen or heard of my application as a result the seller refused to extend the contract which they then cancelled this left me with the loss of my escrow deposit of which is directly attributable to the unprofessional conduct of acc it should be noted that during this process i first appealed to the ceo of     to escalate the situation to management at acc which he refused to do stating that such action would cause even further delays not possible he then agreed to escalate the issue if we did not have a clear to close on the following monday however after monday he still refused to attempt to escalate this case with his counterpart at acc as a last resort i attempted to contact the management of acc directly however the ceo has elected to hide his contact information from customers nor would he return phone calls i eventually made contact with him via his  messaging account and have attached a copy of the transcript he was either incapable or unwilling to help resolve this matter and in my opinion had absolutely no interest in assisting me despite the horrendous position his company had put me in aside from the loss of the property with at least equity my deposit inspection fees time wasted etc this situation has caused unbelievable distress to my wife and i leaving us very stressed and without so much as an apology as a    i have a great deal of direct experience working with mortgage lenders and clients and have never experienced anything even close to the chaos this company have caused further i should disclose that i am a licensed loan originator although i do not transact loans at this stage in my career however i my training ensures some insight into the processes that lenders and borrowers typically follow and this certainly does not comply with any normal process document dates   executed contract provided    loan application   loan proposal provided   summary document issued   appraisal report from acc result is over purchase price   loan estimate   closing disclosure   contract closing date

"loancare llc apparently had a policy change this spring that they did not notify me about where they now only accept one payment a month i had been making half payments every two weeks for over a year so when this policy went into effect it caused one of my half payments to be applied to my loan principal and subsequently for my account to become delinquent i noticed this   and it took six phone calls over six weeks to get this resolved on   loancares phone system is always overloaded with higher than normal call volume and wait times always seem to exceed an hour the times i have opted to give them a phone number to call me back when the next agent is available i have never received a call back at this point i estimate i have wasted around hours on the phone dealing with payment issues where loancare has messed up either misapplying payments or losing payments i will definitely be monitoring my account each month from this point forward since i have not owned my home for very long months i can not refinance at this point without raising my interest rate and payment so this is not an option for me at this time to get away from loancare as soon as it makes sense financially i will be refinancing here is a history of my issues calls from spring summer     call the representative told me my    half payment had been mis applied directly to principal and they would get it reversed to be applied to my payment    call the representative told me their system changed and only accepts one payment a month now and this is why my payment went directly to principal and they would get the    half payment reversed and applied to my payment    call i called again because the payment had not been reversed i was told the representative couldn t tell me why it had not been done yet but they would get it done    call i was told the matter would be escalated to a supervisor because this representative couldn t tell me why no one could get the payment reversed i was told it would take or days to get the payment reversed with the supervisor and to call by    if it had not been reversed    call the representative said she could not escalate or help me because it was already escalated to the supervisor level i asked to have a supervisor call me on monday    because every time i call their phone system says they have high call volume and wait times are greater than an hour the representatives response to me was you got through pretty quick today didn t you that was completely unprofessional and the supervisor never called the payment was actually reversed on    though as of   my account still showed as past due and my    full payment had not posted as of    this electronic payment came out of my bank on   and was supposedly to loancare on    i have never had a payment take longer than days to post so i called them again twice on    once again the automated system said they have high call volume and wait times exceed an hour i put my number in for a call back each time with no call this isn t unexpected because no one ever returned my calls when i was dealing with my first issue from  to    i called promptly at  on    and a representative picked up right away i asked why my account still shows as past due and she looked and said i m not past due i asked why the mobile app and website shows me as past due and she couldn t answer that question i then asked if they had received my    payment and she said they have not she told me to send proof of payment to their payment research department so i did that and provided her the tracking number the system sent me she then said the issue will be investigated and resolved by    and to call back if it has not been resolved    call i had a voicemail from loancare which said they were calling to touch bases with me i called them back and the representative said they were calling to let me know the misapplied funds had been credited to my account i already knew this but asked why the website and mobile app was still showing me as past due the representative said it shouldnt be showing that because i was not late at this point i then asked if they had found the payment and she said they had and it was credited to my account i checked the website and mobile app daily on     and  with still no indication they had posted the so i was set to call loancare the morning of       my account was updated with the payment however i was given no explanation as to what had happened so i made a document inquiry through the website on    asking i noticed a recent payment dispute was resolved
